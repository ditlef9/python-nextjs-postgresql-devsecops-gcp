```

**4. Create main.py**

```python


import flask
import functions_framework

@functions_framework.http
def main(request: flask.wrappers.Request):
    """HTTP Cloud Function"""
    log_headline: str = f"main()"
    print(f"{log_headline} · Init")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("report-excel-generation local run")

    app = flask.Flask(__name__)  # Create a Flask app instance
    request = flask.request
    main(request)
```

**5. Install requirements**

PyCharm > Terminal:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Create Bucket

Google Cloud > Buckets > New

* Name: report-excel-bucket
* Labels: owner: YOUR_NAME
* Location type: Region

Add rule:
* Auto delete after 7 days.


### Publish Application

Change `applications-dev-453706` with your Google Cloud project ID.

```commandline
gcloud auth login
gcloud functions deploy report-excel --gen2 --runtime=python312 --region=europe-north1 --source=. --entry-point=main --trigger-http --timeout=540 --verbosity=info --project=applications-dev-453706 --memory=256Mi --set-env-vars=GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=applications-dev-453706
```

### Add Scheduler

Google Cloud > Scheduler > Create Job

Define the schedule:

* Name: **report-excel-monthly-report**

* Target type: **HTTP**
* URL: **https://news-frontend-644994207224.europe-north1.run.app** (Change with your url)
* Auth header: **Add OIDC token**
* Service account: **Cloud Run Functions and Scheduler Service Account**
* Scope: **https://news-frontend-644994207224.europe-north1.run.app** (Change with your url)

[Create]

### Create secret

* Create secret `report-excel-services` (you can copy `what-version-services`)<br>
```json
{
"gmail_sender_email": "YOU@gmail.com",
"gmail_app_password": "CHANGE ME",
"recipient_email_addresses": "YOU@gmail.com",
"limacharlie_organization_id": "We will enter this later",
"limacharlie_api_key": "We will enter this later"
}
```
