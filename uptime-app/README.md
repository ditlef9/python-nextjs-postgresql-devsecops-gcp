google-cloud-storage        # Added by YOUR_NAME. Interact with Google Cloud Storage for file operations.
```

**4. Create main.py**

```python


import flask
import functions_framework

@functions_framework.http
def main(request: flask.wrappers.Request):
    """HTTP Cloud Function"""
    log_headline: str = f"main()"
    print(f"{log_headline} ¬∑ Init")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("versions-tracker local run")

    app = flask.Flask(__name__)  # Create a Flask app instance
    request = flask.request
    main(request)
```

**5. Install requirements**
