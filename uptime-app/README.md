## ⚛️ 4 Creating Uptime App in Next.js


**1. Create new repository in Github**

* Name: **uptime-nextjs**

**2. Create new application**

Open CMD/Terminal and write:

```
mkdir next
cd next
npx create-next-app@latest
```

* What is your project name: **uptime**
* Would you like to use TypeScript: **Yes**
* Would you like to use ESLint: **Yes**
* Would you like to use Tailwind CSS: **No**
* Would you like yor code inside a `src/` directory: **No**
* Would you like to use App Router? (recommended): **Yes**
* Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?: **No**
* Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)?: **No**

**3. Initialize files to Github**

File > Terminal:

```
echo "# test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

**4. Start the application**

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.


## 🛡️ 5 Implementing DevSecOps: Snyk and ZAP Scan

### Snyk

https://snyk.io

### ZAP Scan

.github/workflows/sec-node.yml<br>
```
name: Security for Next.js - DAST for web with OASP ZAP

on: [push]

jobs:
  dast_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) with OASP ZAP
    steps:
      - name: ZAP Scan
        uses: zaproxy/action-full-scan@v0.10.0
        with:
          target: 'https://your-project-name-t6qfqcqcha-lz.a.run.app/'
```
